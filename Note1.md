## tensorflow

how to install the tensorflow in Windows:

becase scipy is very difficult to install in Windows. It's very hard use:
```Shell Session
pip install tensorflow 
```
if you do have some wrong with it.
Maybe you should use 'Anaconda' to get the python environment.
* From the website
* From Visual stdio 2017, you can click the Python environment.
when you ready: installed the anaconda. you can use 'Anaconda Prompt'
and typed:

```shell Session
# you should change #Alias# to you own name
conda create -n #Alias#
# activeate the environment
activate #Alias#
# just use pip
pip install tensorflow 
```
then add the environment to visual studio.
